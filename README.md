# elder-scrolling
*That's how the elder scrolls*

**Last version works in Gnome environments, never tested elsewhere. `quick_toggle.sh` should work everywhere.**

Scroll using your mouse movements instead of the scrollwheel. By default scroll while holding right click (mouse button 3).

Just install by running `install_mouse_scroll.sh` .

* It will enable the ES scrolling method by default at boot-up.
* If you want **to toggle the Elder-Scrolling mechanism** hit <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> .
* **If you do not want to install** you can run `./quick_toggle.sh` to select and enable a device quickly. This script is standalone.

Should work with any mouse model.

*Original idea by [Jeet Sukumaran](https://jeetblogs.org/) and [Charles Grassin](http://charleslabs.fr/en/index)... And probably you since you searched for it.*
